## My Journey to Design 💫

During my internship at PwC as a business analyst while pursuing a B.S. in Statistics at UW in my junior year, I became intrigued by the reasons behind data changes, user reactions, and product value. This curiosity led me to pursue a double degree in HCI at UW. I aim to bridge the gap between people, products, and colleagues with my interdisciplinary, tech-savvy background.
